<p/>AI Pose Estimation (prototype of AI powered gym tracker) with Python and MediaPope.
<br>
<p/> This gym tracker prototype detect different posts from a webcam feed and render the results to the screen using OpenCV library. 

Additionally we will learn how to extract joint co-ordinates and calcultate joint angle.
<br>
<p/>We will learn how to:
<br>
1. Set up MediaPipe for Python 
<br>  
2. Estimate poses using your Webcam and OpenCV
<br>  
3. Extract join coordinates from the detected pose
4. Calculate angles between joints using Numpy and Trigonometry
5. Building an AI Powered Gym Tracker to count your reps
